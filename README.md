Expose your TCP service behind NAT to remote host.

## todos

### functionalities

- [ ] command line interface for specifying hub `ip:port` and exposed port
  - [ ] default exposed port should be the original service port, as provided by the spoke
- [ ] authentication

### would be nice if we have

- [ ] prebuilt binaries for multiple platforms, including musl builds for Linux
- [ ] cleaned up all my shitty code and logs
- [ ] clearer error handling logic...
